How to use (Linux): 
  1. put the Read_in.py into desired folder
  2. create a new folder named 'Rawdata' 
  3. create a new folder named 'Plots'
  4. unzip your files into 'Rawdata', it should contain 2 files now: anonymized_projects.json and references.json
  5. now run the Read_in.py script via shell command: 
                  $ python Read_in.py
  6. the script produces a file named 'results.txt' which contains the numbers, findings and metrics.
  7. the folder 'Plots' contains now several plots to visualize the data.
